# Algoimpl

Eleven months is a long time to not look at undocumented code. 

I will implement various algorithms in this repository. When I feel that
this repo surpasses my other Algorithms repo in quality (which should not
be hard if I consistently work on this), I will delete my old repo.

1. Chapter 4 of CLRS in Go and C (investigate C++?)
