# Algoimpl

A collection of various algorithms in various languages. I have tried
to organize them into appropriate directories in case anybody wants to
import a package in to their library.

My go [graph](http://godoc.org/github.com/twmb/algoimpl/go/graph) package
is well built. Use it. Give me suggestions.

Everything in here is free for copying and pasting or use anywhere.

where otherwise noted (sort.go, heap.go both are basically identical
to the Go author counterparts because I referenced theirs for comparison).
