# Algoimpl

[Eleven months](http://github.com/twmb/Algorithms) is a long time to not look at undocumented code. 

I will implement various algorithms in this repository. When I feel that
this repo surpasses my other Algorithms repo in quality (which should not
be hard if I consistently work on this) and all my old algorithms are
replicated, I will delete my old repo.
